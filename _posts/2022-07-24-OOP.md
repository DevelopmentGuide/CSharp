OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

#  Object Oriented Programming

##  Inheritance

In C#, `inheritance` is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which is defined in other class.

In C#, the class which inherits the members of another class is called **derived class** and the class whose members are inherited is called base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.

`Advantage` of C# Inheritance

**Code reusability**: Now you can reuse the members of your `parent class`. So, there is no need to define the member `again`. So `less code` is required in the class.

### Inheritance

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public float salary = 40000;
    public void paid()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(salary + " has been paid");
    }
}
public class Programmer : Employee
{
    public float bonus = 10000;
}
class TestInheritance
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Programmer p1 = new Programmer();

        p1.paid();

        Console.WriteLine("Salary: " + p1.salary);
        Console.WriteLine("Bonus: " + p1.bonus);
    }
}
```


### Aggregation

`aggregation` is a process in which one class `defines` **another class** as any `entity reference`. It is another way to **reuse** the class. It is a form of association that represents HAS-A relationship.

```csharp
public class address
{
    public string city;
    public address(string city)
    {
        this.city = city;
    }
}
public class employee
{
    public int id;
    public address address;     //address is called
    public employee(int id, address address) //addressing
    {
        this.id = id;
        this.address = address;
    }
    public void display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(id + "\n" + address.city);
    }
}
public class testAggression
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        address a = new address("chenobyl");        
        employee e = new employee(25094, a); //addressing and creating new
        e.display();
    }
}
```

##  Polymorphism
### Member Overloading

If we create two or more members having same name but different in number or type of parameter, it is known as member overloading. In C#, we can overload:

 - methods,
 - constructors
 - indexed properties

It is because these members have parameters only.

```csharp
public class Cal
{
    public static int add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
    public static float add(float a, float b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
public class TestMemberOverloading
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Cal.add(12, 23));
        Console.WriteLine(Cal.add(12.4f, 21.3f));
    }
}
```


### Method Overriding

If `derived class` defines `same method` as defined in its `base class`, it is known as **method overriding** in C#. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. It enables you to provide specific implementation of the method which is already provided by its `base class`.

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating...");
    }
}
public class Dog : Animal
{
    //overload eat()
    public override void eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating bread...");
    }
}
public class TestOverriding
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();
    }
}
```


### Base

`base` keyword is used to access fields, **constructors** and **methods** of base class.


```csharp
public class animal
{
    public virtual void eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("animal");
    }
}
public class dog : animal
{
    public override void eat()
    {
        base.eat();
        Console.WriteLine("dog");
    }
}
public class program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        dog d = new dog();
        d.eat();
    }
}
```


### Polymorphism

The term `Polymorphism` is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many forms. It is a greek word. In object-oriented programming, we use 3 main concepts: `inheritance`, `encapsulation` and `polymorphism`.

There are two types of polymorphism in C#: **compile time polymorphism** and **runtime polymorphism**. 

`Compile time polymorphism` is achieved by method overloading and operator overloading in C#. It is also known as static binding or early binding. 

`Runtime polymorphism` in achieved by method overriding which is also known as dynamic binding or late binding.


```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public string color = "white";

}
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public string color = "black";
}
public class TestSealed
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Animal d = new Dog();
        Console.WriteLine(d.color);

    }
}
```


### Sealed

`sealed` keyword **applies restrictions** on the class and method. If you create a sealed class, it cannot be derived. If you create a sealed method, it **cannot be overridden**.

```csharp
sealed public class Animal
{
    public void eat() { Console.WriteLine("eating..."); }
}
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void bark() { Console.WriteLine("barking..."); }
}
public class TestSealed
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();
        d.bark();
    }
}

```

##  Abstraction

`Abstract classes` are the way to achieve abstraction in C#. Abstraction in C# is the process to hide the internal details and showing functionality only. Abstraction can be achieved by two ways:

1. Abstract class
2. Interface

Abstract class and interface both can have abstract methods which are necessary for abstraction.


### Abstract

A method which is declared abstract and has no body is called `abstract method`. It can be declared inside the `abstract class only`. Its implementation must be provided by derived classes. 
Example

    public abstract void draw();  


```csharp
public abstract class Shape  
{  
    public abstract void draw();  
}  
public class Rectangle : Shape  
{  
    public override void draw()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("drawing rectangle...");  
    }  
}  
public class Circle : Shape  
{  
    public override void draw()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("drawing circle...");  
    }  
}  
public class TestAbstract  
{  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
        Shape s;  
        s = new Rectangle();  
        s.draw();  
        s = new Circle();  
        s.draw();  
    }  
}  
```

### Interface

`Interface` in C# is a **blueprint** of a class. It is like abstract class because all the methods which are declared inside the interface are abstract methods. It **cannot** have `method body` and **cannot** be `instantiated`.

It is used to `achieve multiple inheritance` which **cannot** be `achieved by class`. It is used to achieve fully `abstraction` because it **cannot** have `method body`.

Its implementation must be provided by class or struct. The `class` or `struct` which implements the `interface`, must provide the implementation of all the methods declared inside the interface.

```csharp
public interface Drawable
{
    void Draw();
}
public class Rec : Drawable
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("draw rec");
    }
}
public class Circle : Drawable
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("draw Circle");
    }
}
public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Drawable d;
        d = new Rec();
        d.Draw();
        d = new Circle();
        d.Draw();
    }
}
```

##  Namespace

### Namespaces

`Namespaces` in C# are used to organize `too many classes` so that it can be `easy` to **handle the application**.

To use that specific namespace define it using
```csharp
using namespace;
```

### Access Modifiers

Access modifiers or specifiers are the keywords that are used to specify accessibility or scope of variables and functions in the C# application.

C# provides five types of access specifiers.

1. `Public`: It specifies that access is not restricted.

2. `Protected`: It specifies that access is limited to the containing class or in derived class.

3. `Internal`: It specifies that access is limited to the current assembly.

4. `Protected internal`: It specifies that access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class.

5. `Private`: It specifies that access is limited to the containing type.

We can choose any of these to protect our data. `Public` is **not restricted** and `Private` is **most restricted**. The following table describes about the accessibility of each.


### Encapsulation

`Encapsulation` is the concept of **wrapping data** into a `single unit`. It collects `data members` and `member functions` into a `single unit` called **class**. The `purpose` of encapsulation is to prevent alteration of data from outside. This data can only be accessed by getter functions of the class.

```csharp
class Rectangle {
    //member variables
    public double length;
    public double width;
    
    public double GetArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
    public void Display() {
        Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", length);
        Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", width);
        Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", GetArea());
    }
}//end class Rectangle
```

```csharp
class ExecuteRectangle {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
        r.length = 4.5;
        r.width = 3.5;
        r.Display();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}

```
