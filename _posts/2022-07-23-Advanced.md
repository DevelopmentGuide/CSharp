Strings are used for storing text. A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. The FileStream is a class used for reading and writing files in C#. Collections standardize the way of which the objects are handled by your program.

##  Strings

In C#, `string` is an `object` of `System`.
String class that represent sequence of characters. We can perform many operations on strings such as `concatenation`, `comparision`, `getting substring`, `search`, `trim`, `replacement` etc.

**string vs String**

In C#, `string` is keyword which is an alias for `System.String class`. 
That is why string and String are equivalent. We are free to use any naming convention.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-strings)


```csharp
//String Clone () method
string s1 = "Hello ";
string s2 = (String)s1.Clone();

//String Compare () method
Console.WriteLine(string.Compare(s1, s2));

//String Concat () method
Console.WriteLine(string.Concat(s1, s2));

//String Contains () method
Console.WriteLine(s1.Contains(s2));

//String Format () method
string s3 = string.Format("{0:D}", DateTime.Now);
Console.WriteLine(s3);

//String IndexOf () method
int index = s1.IndexOf('e');
Console.WriteLine(index);

//String Insert () method
string s4 = s1.Insert(5, "-");
Console.WriteLine(s4);

//String Join () method
string[] s5 = { "Hello", "C#", "by", "javatpoint" };
string s6 = string.Join("-", s5);
Console.WriteLine(s6);
```

##  Exception Handling

`Exception Handling` in C# is a process to **handle runtime errors**. We perform exception handling so that normal flow of the application can be maintained even after runtime errors.

In C#, `exception` is an event or object which is *thrown at runtime*. All exceptions the derived from System.Exception class. It is a runtime error which can be handled. If we don't handle the exception, it prints exception message and terminates the program.

In C#, we use 4 keywords to perform exception handling:

1. try
2. catch
3. finally
4. throw

### try/catch

In C# programming, `exception handling` is performed by try/catch statement. 
The `try` block in C# is used to place the code that may `throw exception`. The `catch` block is used to `handle the exception`. The catch block must be preceded by try block.

```csharp
try
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 0;
    int c = a / b;
}
catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e); }

Console.WriteLine("Done");
```

### finally

C# `finally block` is used to execute important code which is to be executed whether exception is handled or not. It must be preceded by `catch` or `try block`.

```csharp
try
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 0;
    int c = a / b;
}
catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e); }

finally { Console.WriteLine("Done"); }
```

### Custom Exception

C# allows us to create `user-defined` or `custom exception`. It is used to make the meaningful exception.

{ Reference} (https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-user-defined-exceptions)


### checked unchecked

C# provides `checked` and `unchecked` keyword to handle integral type exceptions. Checked and unchecked keywords specify checked `context` and `unchecked context` respectively. In checked context, arithmetic overflow raises an exception whereas, in an unchecked context, arithmetic overflow is ignored and result is `truncated`.

**C# Checked**

The `checked keyword` is used to explicitly check overflow and conversion of integral type values at compile time.

{ Reference} (https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-checked-and-unchecked)


### SystemException

The `SystemException` is a predefined exception class in C#. It is used to handle system related exceptions. It works as base class for system exception namespace. 

It has various child classes like: `ValidationException`, `ArgumentException`, `ArithmeticException`, `DataException`, `StackOverflowException` etc.



{ Reference} (https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-systemexception)

##  File IO

### FileStream

C# `FileStream` class provides a stream for file operation. It can be used to perform synchronous and asynchronous read and write operations. By the help of FileStream class, we can easily `read` and `write` `data into file`.

```csharp
//creating file stream 
FileStream f = new FileStream("e:\\b.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);

//writing byte into stream 
f.WriteByte(65); 

//closing stream  
f.Close();
```

### StreamWriter

`StreamWriter` class is used to `write` characters to a stream in `specific encoding`. It inherits TextWriter class. It provides overloaded `write()` and `writeln()` methods to write data into file.

```csharp
//creating file stream 
FileStream f = new FileStream("d:\\v.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);

StreamWriter s = new StreamWriter(f);

s.WriteLine("hello c#");
s.Close();
f.Close();

Console.WriteLine("File created successfully...");
```


### StreamReader

`StreamReader` class is used to read string from the stream. It inherits TextReader class. It provides `Read()` and `ReadLine()` methods to **read data** from the **stream**.

```csharp
//creating file stream 
FileStream f = new FileStream("d:\\v.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);

StreamReader s = new StreamReader(f);

String line = s.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine(line);

s.Close();
f.Close();
```


### TextWriter

`TextWriter` class is an `abstract class`. It is used to write text or sequential series of characters into file. It is found in `System.IO` namespace.



```csharp
using (TextWriter writer = File.CreateText("d:\\v.txt"))
{
    writer.WriteLine("Hello C#");
    writer.WriteLine("C# File Handling");
}
Console.WriteLine("Data written successfully...");
```


### TextReader

`TextReader` class is found in System.IO namespace. It represents a `reader` that can be used to read text or sequential series of characters.

```csharp
using (TextReader tr = File.OpenText("e:\\f.txt"))  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(tr.ReadToEnd());  
}  
```


### BinaryWriter

`BinaryWriter` class is used to write `binary information` into stream. It is found in System.IO namespace. It also supports writing string in `specific encoding`.

```csharp
string fileName = "e:\\binaryfile.dat";  
using (BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(File.Open(fileName, FileMode.Create)))  
{  
    writer.Write(2.5);  
    writer.Write("this is string data");  
    writer.Write(true);  
}  
Console.WriteLine("Data written successfully...");    
```


### BinaryReader

`BinaryReader` class is used to `read binary information` from stream. It is found in System.IO namespace. It also supports reading string in specific encoding.


```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)  
{  
    WriteBinaryFile();  
    ReadBinaryFile();  
    Console.ReadKey();  
}  
static void WriteBinaryFile()  
{  
    using (BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(File.Open("e:\\binaryfile.dat", FileMode.Create)))  
    {  
            
        writer.Write(12.5);  
        writer.Write("this is string data");  
        writer.Write(true);  
    }  
}  
static void ReadBinaryFile()  
{  
    using (BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(File.Open("e:\\binaryfile.dat", FileMode.Open)))  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Double Value : " + reader.ReadDouble());  
        Console.WriteLine("String Value : " + reader.ReadString());  
        Console.WriteLine("Boolean Value : " + reader.ReadBoolean());  
    } 
}
```



### StringWriter

This `class` is used to write and deal with `string data` `rather than files`. It is `derived class of TextWriter class`. The string data written by `StringWriter` class is stored into `StringBuilder`.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-stringwriter)


### StringReader

`StringReader` class is used to read data written by the StringWriter class. It is `subclass of TextReader class`. It enables us to `read a string synchronously` or `asynchronously`. It provides constructors and methods to perform read operations.



### FileInfo

The `FileInfo` class is used to `deal with file` and its `operations in C#`. It provides `properties` and `methods` that are used to `create`, `delete` and `read` file. It uses StreamWriter class to write data to the file. It is a part of System.IO namespace.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-fileinfo)


### DirectoryInfo

`DirectoryInfo` class is a part of System.IO namespace. It is used to create, delete and move directory. It `provides` methods to perform operations related to `directory` and `subdirectory`. It is a `sealed class` so, we cannot inherit it.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-directoryinfo)


### Serialization

In C#, `serialization` is the process of converting object into byte stream so that it can be saved to `memory`, `file` or `database`. The reverse process of serialization is called `deserialization`.


```csharp

using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;
[Serializable]
class Student
{
    int rollno;
    string name;
    public Student(int rollno, string name)
    {
        this.rollno = rollno;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
public class SerializeExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        FileStream stream = new FileStream("d:\\v.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);
        BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();

        Student s = new Student(101, "sonoo");
        formatter.Serialize(stream, s);

        stream.Close();
    }
}
```



### Deserialization

In C# programming, `deserialization` is the reverse process of serialization. It means you can read the object from byte stream. Here, we are going to use `BinaryFormatter`.Deserialize(stream) method to `deserialize` the stream.


```csharp
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;
[Serializable]
class Student
{
    public int rollno;
    public string name;
    public Student(int rollno, string name)
    {
        this.rollno = rollno;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
public class DeserializeExample
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        FileStream stream = new FileStream("d:\\v.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);
        BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();

        Student s = (Student)formatter.Deserialize(stream);
        Console.WriteLine("Rollno: " + s.rollno);
        Console.WriteLine("Name: " + s.name);

        stream.Close();
    }
}
```



### System.IO

The System.IO namespace consists of IO related classes, structures, delegates and enumerations. These classes can be used to reads and write data to files or data streams. It also contains classes for file and directory support.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-system-io)

##  Collections
### Collections

In C#, collection represents group of objects. By the help of collections, we can perform various operations on objects such as


 -store object
 -update object
 -delete object
 -retrieve object
 -search object
 - sort object

In sort, all the data structure work can be performed by C# collections.

We can store objects in array or collection. Collection has advantage over array. Array has size limit but objects stored in collection can grow or shrink dynamically.

Types of Collections in C#
There are 3 ways to work with collections. The three namespaces are given below:

1. System.Collections.Generic classes
2. System.Collections classes(Now deprecated)
3. System.Collections.Concurrent classes


### List

C# `List<T> class` is used to store and fetch elements. It can have duplicate elements. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.

```csharp
// Create a list of strings  
var names = new List<string>();
names.Add("ABC");
names.Add("DEF");
names.Add("GHI");

// Iterate list element using foreach loop  
foreach (var name in names)
{
    Console.WriteLine(name);
}
```

### HashSet

C# `HashSet class` can be used to store, remove or view elements. It does not store duplicate elements. It is suggested to use HashSet class if you have to store only `unique elements`. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### SortedSet

C# `SortedSet class` can be used to `store`, `remove` or `view` elements. It maintains ascending order and **does not** store duplicate elements. It is suggested to use `SortedSet` class if you have to store `unique elements` and `maintain ascending order`. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### Stack

C# `Stack<T> class` is used to `push` and `pop` elements. It uses the concept of `Stack` that arranges elements in LIFO (Last In First Out) order. It **can** have `duplicate elements`. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### Queue

C# `Queue<T> class` is used to Enqueue and Dequeue elements. It uses the concept of Queue that arranges elements in FIFO (First In First Out) order. It **can** have `duplicate elements`. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### LinkedList

C# `LinkedList<T> class` uses the concept of linked list. It allows us to insert and delete elements fastly. It **can** have `duplicate elements`. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### Dictionary

C# `Dictionary<TKey, TValue> class` uses the concept of hashtable. It stores values on the basis of key. It contains unique keys only. By the help of key, we can easily search or remove elements. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### SortedDictionary

C# `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue> class` uses the concept of hashtable. It stores values on the basis of key. It contains unique keys and maintains ascending order on the basis of key. By the help of key, we can easily `search` or `remove` elements. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.


### SortedList

C# `SortedList<TKey, TValue>` is an `array` of key/value pairs. It stores values on the basis of key. The SortedList<TKey, TValue> class contains unique keys and maintains ascending order on the basis of key. By the help of key, we can easily `search` or `remove` elements. It is found in System.Collections.Generic namespace.

```csharp
names.Add("1","AAA");    
foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> kv in names)  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(kv.Key+" "+kv.Value);  
}  
```



- - - -



###  Generics

`Generic` is a concept that allows us to define `classes` and `methods` with placeholder. C# compiler replaces these placeholders with specified type at `compile time`. The concept of generics is **used** to create `general purpose classes and methods`.

o define `generic class`, we must use angle <> brackets. The angle brackets are used to declare a class or method as generic type. In the following example, we are creating generic class that can be used to deal with any type of data.


```csharp
class GenericClass<T>
{
    public GenericClass(T msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(msg);
    }
}
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GenericClass<string> gen = new GenericClass<string>("This is generic class");
        GenericClass<int> genI = new GenericClass<int>(101);
        GenericClass<char> getCh = new GenericClass<char>('I');
    }
}
```


### Delegates

In C#, `delegate` is a reference to the method. It works like function pointer in C and C++. But it is `objected-oriented`, secured and type-safe than `function pointer`.

For static method, delegate encapsulates method only. But for instance method, it **encapsulates** `method` and `instance` both.

The best use of delegate is to use as event.

Internally a delegate declaration defines a class which is the derived class of System.Delegate.



```csharp
delegate int Calculator(int n);//declaring delegate  

public class DelegateExample
{
    static int number = 100;
    public static int add(int n)
    {
        number = number + n;
        return number;
    }
    public static int mul(int n)
    {
        number = number * n;
        return number;
    }
    public static int getNumber()
    {
        return number;
    }
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Calculator c1 = new Calculator(add);//instantiating delegate  
        Calculator c2 = new Calculator(mul);
        c1(20);//calling method using delegate  
        Console.WriteLine("After c1 delegate, Number is: " + getNumber());
        c2(3);
        Console.WriteLine("After c2 delegate, Number is: " + getNumber());

    }
}

```


### Reflection

`reflection` is a process to get metadata of a type at runtime.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-reflection)



### Anonymous Function

`Anonymous function` is a type of function that does not has name. In other words, we can say that a function without name is known as anonymous function.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-anonymous-function)



### Multithreading

`Multithreading` in C# is a process in which multiple threads work simultaneously. It is a process to `achieve multitasking`. It saves time because multiple tasks are being executed at a time. To create multithreaded application in C#, we need to use System.Threding namespace.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-multithreading)



### Thread Life Cycle

In C#, each `thread` has a life cycle. The life cycle of a thread is started when instance of System.Threading.`Thread class` is created. When the task execution of the thread is completed, its life cycle is `ended`.

[Reference](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-thread-life-cycle)
